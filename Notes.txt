*** Main Fixes for MVP ***
- Terminal style is really cool, keep going with that
- Make it so blog-list components (BlogPost) adjust to whatever screen size/adjustment
- Make blogs scroll down so it doesn't add to the length of the page
- Add "About me" Page; Pretty basic, make same layout as blogposts
- Add images and a decent way of formatting them so it works well with the website
- Add subscribe feature and email notifications for users
- Add a buy me coffee donation button
- Add a section at the start for an audio clip; Probably put in the BlogLayout.astro

*** Features ***
- Add search bar for specific blogs users want w/ tags
- Add preview button on each blog list that can allow people to view the article on the righthand side before reading it
- Make images "load" bit by bit, cool animation
  - Maybe do text as well? Similar to Fallout text being loaded onto Pipboy!
