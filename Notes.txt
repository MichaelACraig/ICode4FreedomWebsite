*** Main Fixes for MVP ***
- Terminal for homepage
  - ASCII Animations;
- Add subscribe feature and email notifications for users

*** Features ***
- Add loading text to each blogpost similar to how a terminal loads in text
- Add search bar for specific blogs users want w/ tags
- Add a music section for songs I like (Reference Poolsuite's way of doing it!)

- Add color change to light mode, with it being more of a stylistic change than a basic color change
  - Creams, Whites, Romanesque vibes to represent philosophy/stoic side of my personality. Can represent how I enjoy both technology and the brutal design/style choices of it + how I merge that with that kind of style.

** Important Notes **
- Make sure you put trackName as a variable within the frontmatter if you have an audio clip and
 ensure it corresponds to the name of the audio clip! This makes it so the AudioTrack component pops up when an audio track for a blog
 is available
