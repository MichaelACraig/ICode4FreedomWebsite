*** Main Fixes for MVP ***
- Terminal style is really cool, keep going with that
  - Focus on interactability; should feel like a user is interacting with a terminal to read the blogposts
- Add images and a decent way of formatting them so it works well with the website
  - Have user click a button to "load" the image; interactability
  - Make images "load" bit by bit, cool animation
- Add subscribe feature and email notifications for users

*** Features ***
- Add search bar for specific blogs users want w/ tags
- Add preview button on each blog list that can allow people to view the article on the righthand side before reading it
  - Maybe do text as well? Similar to Fallout text being loaded onto Pipboy!
- Add color change to light mode, with it being more of a stylistic change than a basic color change
  - Creams, Whites, Romanesque vibes to represent philosophy/stoic side of my personality. Can represent how I enjoy both technology and the brutal design/style choices of it + how I merge that with that kind of style.

** Important Notes **
- Make sure you put trackName as a variable within the frontmatter if you have an audio clip and
 ensure it corresponds to the name of the audio clip! This makes it so the AudioTrack component pops up when an audio track for a blog
 is available
