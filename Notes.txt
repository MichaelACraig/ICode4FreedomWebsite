*** Main Fixes for MVP ***
- Terminal style is really cool, keep going with that
- Add "About me" Page; Pretty basic, make same layout as blogposts
- Add images and a decent way of formatting them so it works well with the website
- Add subscribe feature and email notifications for users
- Add a section at the start for an audio clip; Probably put in the BlogLayout.astro

*** Features ***
- Add search bar for specific blogs users want w/ tags
- Add preview button on each blog list that can allow people to view the article on the righthand side before reading it
- Make images "load" bit by bit, cool animation
  - Maybe do text as well? Similar to Fallout text being loaded onto Pipboy!
- Add color change to light mode, with it being more of a stylistic change than a basic color change
  - Creams, Whites, Romanesque vibes to represent philosophy/stoic side of my personality. Can represent how I enjoy both technology and the brutal design/style choices of it + how I merge that with that kind of style.
