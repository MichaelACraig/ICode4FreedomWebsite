Hi there, my name is Michael. I'm a Computer Science student that has general expertise in many different areas of Computer Science, from AI/ML to Web Dev. I'm actually learning Astro + Preact to build out this website!

On this website, I'll be posting about book reviews, technology related content, insights into my own philosophy, and other topics I feel like writing about. 

I was first introduced to technology when I was 9, where I built my first computer for gaming. After learning about the power of technology, my mind was off to the races. I spent a lot of my high school years experimenting with the idea of being a doctor or a stock broker, but I've always been interested in technology! I never ended up coding until I got to college because of this, but I've immersed myself in technology ever since. 

I've never really seen myself as a remarkable person and have basically been coasting through life, but it's gotten me pretty far along. I go to a Top-10 university in the US and I have everything lined up for me to succeed when I leave college. Even with all of this success on paper, something just felt wrong, missing. I realized that I wasn't living with intention, and even though this coasting has gotten me far, it has not led me to anything fufilling. I've just been going through the motions instead of truly living my life. I've realized that if I continue to live this way that once I graduate, I'll find a well-paying job and settle, not really living a fufilling life and just be another face in the corporate world. This isn't the type of life I want to lead, and I decided to change my life and live intentionally.

# My Vision

The main vision I have for my life and what leads my purpose-driven actions is through this vision:
#### <ins>"To build technology that aides, enables and enhances people, rather than erode, imprison and disable."</ins>
If the technology I work on can help people, even just one person, then it's worth doing to the best of my ability. That's part of the reason I'm making this website, because it helps me to understand myself, and might help others understand themselves as well!

Technology is something that should be driving us forward, not holding us back. I find it appaling that some of the world's greatest minds are working on technologies that are designed to keep us engaged and train us to come back for more. This is the kind of technology that falls into the negative category of my vision. I believe a lot of people in tech feel this same way, but companies have enticed talent with high salaries, amazing benefits, and a sense of security. Those working on technology are within this category, working on small things to keep the bigger system running, or strung up in corporate beauracracy not driving meaningful impact to the work they do. There is nobody or no company that is directly to blame, but it is the system of Consumerism that is the main culprit to this problem.

Because of this system, most people are trained to consume content and we look at this activity in a negative light if done mindlessly and habitually, but it's exactly the action of consuming content that can free the mind from the loop of engagement and wasted time. I hope you stick around and learn something, whether it be through my book reviews, programming projects, insights on philosophy, or the random topics I decide to write about. My goal for this website/blog is to just make an impact on someone, and if I can do that, then it's served its purpose.

Just know that I'm a real person, just like you, who just wants to help others, and write about what I've learned to help myself be more equip to do so.

I do it all for freedom; Freedom of my mind and the ability to live my life with purpose. I hope that choose to live freely, and with intention and purpose as well. Thanks for reading :)
